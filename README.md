# White-Wine-Quality-Prediction
Is it wine o'clock yet? No matter if red or white - There are wine enthusiasts all around
the world. However, people often wonder how they can ensure that the bottle they bought
is a good quality wine. Can they rely solely on the price or the year of the wine? Or
looking at it from the other perspective, how can I, as a wine producer, ensure that my
wine quality will meet the consumers' expectations? To find more certainty about these
questions, our group has decided to choose this topic.


We want to examine the expectation if a wine's quality will be good enough to launch it
to the high-end wine market in the role of the R&D department of a wine-producing
company. In this context, the wine quality can vary from a scale of 1 to 10 and measured
based on physicochemical variables such as alcohol, sulfates, volatile acidity, density,
etc. We will focus on white wine data. Our target is the high-end white wine market. The
segmentation for good wine starts with a score above 6. The data can be retrieved from
Kaggle.
